# Carbon-Summarizer
A web-based system designed to enhance information retrieval efficiency while promoting environmental sustainability. The system integrates automated text summarization with carbon footprint estimation, helping users reduce unnecessary browsing and track the environmental impact of their search activities.
# Key Features
The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated text summarization, reducing the need for users to open multiple web pages and thereby minimizing energy consumption. It incorporates both extractive and abstractive summarization methods to refine search results efficiently. Additionally, the carbon footprint estimation module analyzes various factors such as server energy consumption, data transmission, and computational workload to calculate the environmental impact of search activities. The processed data is presented through an interactive dashboard, offering real-time insights into search-related energy consumption and providing actionable recommendations for reducing digital carbon footprints. The system also includes a robust data processing pipeline to ensure accurate collection, validation, and analysis of search-related data, improving the precision of energy usage estimates. By integrating sustainability recommendations, users receive guidance on optimizing their search behavior, such as refining queries, minimizing redundant searches, and choosing eco-friendly search engines. Through this dual-purpose approach, the system enhances both search efficiency and environmental awareness, making digital consumption more sustainable.
